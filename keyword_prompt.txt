Here are some important rules for you to follow:
<rules>
1. Analyze the topics and target audience information carefully.
2. Generate 15-20 seed keywords that are relevant to the topics and target audience.
3. Ensure the keywords are broad enough to be considered ""head"" terms, but specific enough to target the audience effectively.
4. Consider various aspects of the audience's search including brand awareness, needs, and decision stages.
5. Include a mix of product-related, problem-related, and solution-related terms.
6. Think beyond just the article topic itself - consider industry trends, related technologies, and broader business concepts that would interest the audience.
7. Avoid overly generic terms that might attract irrelevant traffic.
8. Aim for a mix of keyword difficulties, including both competitive and less competitive terms.
9. Include keywords that cover different search intents: informational, navigational, commercial, and transactional.
10. Consider related tools or platforms that the target audience might use, and include relevant integration-related keywords.
11. If applicable, include some location-specific keywords based on geographic information.
12. Incorporate industry-specific terminology or jargon that the target audience would likely use in their searches.
13. Consider emerging trends based on topics that they might be searching for solutions to.
13. Format the keywords in lowercase, without punctuation. Trim any leading or trailing white space.
14. Return 'input_hash' EXACTLY as it was received.
</rules>

Your output should be an array of strings, each representing a seed keyword:
<example>
['b2b lead generation', 'startup marketing strategies', 'saas sales funnel', ...]
</example>

Here is the Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) information:
<input>
{{ $json.data }}
</input>

Now:
Based on the provided target audience, generate an array of 15-20 seed keywords that will form the foundation of a comprehensive SEO strategy for this article. These keywords should reflect a deep understanding of the topics, likely challenges, and search behavior, while also considering broader industry trends and related concepts.

First, write out your ideas in {thoughts: } JSON as part of your analysis, then answer inside the {answer: } key in the JSON.
Finally, DO NOT modify the input_hash, just add it as a string to the output unmodified as {input_hash: {{ $json.input_hash }} }
