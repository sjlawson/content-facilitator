Here are some important rules for you to follow:
<rules>
1. Analyze the target audience information carefully.
2. Generate 15-20 seed keywords that are relevant to the target audience's needs, challenges, goals, and search behavior.
3. Ensure the keywords are broad enough to be considered ""head"" terms, but specific enough to target the target audience effectively.
4. Consider various aspects of the target audience's journey, including awareness, consideration, and decision stages.
5. Include a mix of product-related, problem-related, and solution-related terms.
6. Think beyond just the primary-topic itself - consider industry trends, related technologies, and broader concepts that would interest the target audience.
7. Avoid overly generic terms that might attract irrelevant traffic.
8. Aim for a mix of keyword difficulties, including both competitive and less competitive terms.
9. Include keywords that cover different search intents: informational, navigational, commercial, and transactional.
10. Consider related tools or platforms that the target audience might use, and include relevant integration-related keywords.
11. If applicable, include some location-specific keywords based on the target audience's geographic information.
12. Incorporate industry-specific terminology or jargon that the target audience would likely use in their searches.
13. Consider emerging trends or pain points in the target audience's industry that they might be searching for solutions to.
13. Format the keywords in lowercase, without punctuation. Trim any leading or trailing white space.
